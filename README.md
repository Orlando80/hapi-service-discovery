hapi-service-discovery
---

Plugin for hapi to wrap announce/unannounce functionality

Connects the discovery client, exposes routes for announce, unannounce (so that you can control the server externally), and wraps the logging to server.log

Currently depends on some closed-source modules which we are in the process of open-sourcing
